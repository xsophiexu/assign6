      <h2>Efforts for Relief</h2>

      <p>As a part of the <a href="https://thebronx.org/">Bronx Community Relief Effort</a>, organizations from across the Bronx have been meeting weekly to collaborate on addressing the tech needs of the borough, connecting the disconnected, and strengthening existing community-based solutions. The Bronx Tech and Connectivity collective includes representatives from organizations such as THE POINT CDC, DreamYard, The Bronx Community Foundation, The Knowledge House, Lehman College, Bronx Documentary Center, Per Scholas, NYPL, and the NYC DOE. The group recognizes that there has been a digital divide for far too long in the Bronx with the COVID-19 pandemic only deepening the disparities. Existing and proposed collaborative projects include distributing over 1,300 laptops and hotspots to schools and students, setting up Tech Lending Libraries across the Bronx, expanding community-controlled mesh networks in new Bronx neighborhoods, and developing a Bronx IT help desk. The group is always looking for new partners and advocates who can help connect the Bronx to the vital services and communication tools required to thrive in today's world. </p>
